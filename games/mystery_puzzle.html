      <div class="two-column-description">
        <p id="normalText" style="margin-top: 0px;">
          In 2012 “Candy Crush Saga” took the world of mobile gaming by surprise. Multiple similar games were successful
          around that time, “Puzzle & Dragons”, “Farm Heroes Saga”, “Monster Busters”, etc. It seems that the mobile
          medium is a perfect match for swipe mechanics and light brain teasers. Back then all designers wanted to come
          up with new puzzle mechanics, in search of the holy grail of mobile gaming.
          <br><br>
          A few years later I was obsessed with “Spooky Pop”, a game by Supercell that was soft-launched but never fully
          released, and I decided to try something of that sort. I thought of different mechanics and I prototyped a
          couple of them with Game Maker.
          <br><br>
          Once I thought the concept was solid enough (spoiler: it wasn’t) I got in touch with three friends from
          university that were running an animation studio back then. Later joined a developer who was a common friend
          of ours, this way we created a very talented team …if somewhat unbalanced, with three artists, one designer,
          and a single programmer.
          <br><br>
          The game never reached very far, because coordinating a team of 5 people who collaborate in their spare time
          it’s almost an impossible task and we moved very slowly. Understandably, different people had different levels
          of motivation and energy to tackle this venture. And the worst is that I found myself doing documentation,
          meetings and emails instead of being hands-on in the game. All of a sudden this project “for fun” resembled
          too much like work, but with far more precarious conditions. And last, but not least, I also had the looming
          impression that the game wouldn’t turn out as fun as I expected.
          <br><br>
          The puzzle mechanics were truly novel and for that I’m very proud, and the art and aesthetics were truly
          special too. But “different” is not enough to succeed as a game needs to be not only “different” but also
          “better” than the established proposals out there.
