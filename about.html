    <!-- Description -->
    <p id="highlightedText">About Me</p>
    <div class="about-grid">
      <div style="margin-right: 30px;">
        <p id="normalText">My name is Xavier, I was born in Barcelona and I’ve been working on mobile games since 2007.
          During this time I lived in Paris, New York and Chengdu, released a bunch of projects (some of them quite
          successful) and collaborated next to countless professionals from whom I got as much learning as inspiration.
        </p>
        <p id="normalText">When I was in kindergarten, the teacher complained to my parents that I was too playful. This
          sense of play has always accompanied me since I have a memory. As a kid I used to draw "castle sections" with
          obstacle courses (spikes, lasers, crocodiles…) which later I traversed in my mind with an imaginary invisible
          man …toying with “level design” before I even knew it was a thing. As a teen I made my first games with “Klik
          & Play” (later “Multimedia Fusion”) and when in college with “Macromedia Flash”.</p>
        <p id="normalText">  …but I don’t play games at work! I have a strong work ethic and during my career I’ve been 
          in all kinds of roles, ranging from hands-on tasks like making levels or documentation to leading (small) teams 
          by providing creative vision and planning. I am very action oriented and always worked fully or partially in the 
          development trenches. I have a wide range of skills for what you could call ...a swiss knife of game design!</p>
        <p id="normalText">As a gamer I might have a soft spot for niche, peculiar games, but in the professional field
          my main priority is profitability in the increasingly competitive field of F2P. I’m open to all kinds of
          themes, genres and demographics, as long as the business opportunity is there and we come up with a solid
          plan. On the other hand, while I acknowledge the industry is a data-driven, product-centric environment, I
          will do my best in a culture that leaves room for creative intuition, fosters bold action and understands that
          sometimes you reach business goals in oblique ways.</p>
        <p id="normalText">I’m very proud of my games portfolio, but I’m convinced that the best is yet to come. And,
          who knows, maybe we can work together on the next big thing.</p>
